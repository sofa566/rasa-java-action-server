# Rasa Java Action Server
Action server for the Rasa custom actions

You can use this implementation of the action server as a starting point for your own chatbot based on [Rasa](https://rasa.com/).

Using the action server, you can focus on the business logic (defined within custom actions). Everything else is already done for you.

Rasa Core sends a request to the action server to execute a certain custom action. As a response to the action call from Core, you can modify the tracker, e.g. by setting slots and send responses back to the user.

![Action Server](doc/rasa_java_action_server.png)

Action server exposes an API that is used by Rasa to execute custom actions. The following endpoints are supported:

| Endpoint    | Description           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| GET /health        | Ping endpoint to check if the server is running and well.              |
| GET /actions        | List all registered actions.              |
| POST /webhook        | It allows you to run the custom action. This endpoint should be set in the ``endpoints.yml`` file in Rasa.              |

## Usage

Before starting the action server ensure that contains your custom action.

#### 1. Adding custom actions

You can create two types of custom actions:
- **general** - which corresponds to [Rasa Custom Action](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/actions/#custom-actions). To use this kind of actions, you can create a Java class which implement the ``io.github.rbajek.rasa.sdk.action.Action`` interface.
- **forms** - which corresponds to [Rasa Forms](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/forms/). Ths kind of actions should extends the ``io.github.rbajek.rasa.sdk.action.form.AbstractFormAction``

To add your custom action, you can create a Java class which implement/extend an appropriate interface/class. Recommended package for your custom actions is ``io.github.rbajek.rasa.action.server.action.custom``. Afterwards, you have to register your custom action in ``io.github.rbajek.rasa.sdk.ActionExecutor``. 

**Tip:** If you want your custom action to be automatically registered, your action has to be as Spring component.


**Attention:** action server contains two examples of custom actions:
- [ActionJoke.java](https://github.com/rbajek/rasa-java-action-server/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/rbajek/rasa/action/server/action/custom/joke/ActionJoke.java) - as the general action (based on [original example](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/running-rasa-with-docker/#creating-a-custom-action))
- [RestaurantFormAction.java](https://github.com/rbajek/rasa-java-action-server/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/rbajek/rasa/action/server/action/custom/form/restaurant/RestaurantFormAction.java) - as the form action, which implement functionality of [Restaurant Form](https://blog.rasa.com/building-contextual-assistants-with-rasa-formaction/)

#### 2. Starting the actio server

In order to start the action server using implemented custom actions, fisrt of all, you have to build the application:

```
mvnw clean package
```

next, you ca run server as follows:

```
java -jar target\rasa-java-action-server.jar
```

##### Docker

If you are using docker you can build the docker image:

```
docker build -t rasa-action-server:1.0.0
```

and tun it:

```
docker run -p 5055:8080 --name rasa-action-server rasa-action-server:1.0.0
```

#### 3. Set the URL in Rasa Core

Rasa core has to know what is the URL of your custom server. To set this, you have to set the ``/webhook`` endpoint in the ``endpoints.yml`` within the Rasa server (see [custom action](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/actions/#custom-actions)):

For example:

```yml
action_endpoint:
  url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"
```
#### 4. start botfront using docker-compose
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-java.yml up
